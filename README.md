# Austin's Shifting Ground: A Cultural Displacement Map

This project is an interactive data visualization tool designed to document four decades of demographic, economic, and cultural change across 15 Austin neighborhoods from 1990 to 2025.

## Project Overview

As Austin continues to grow, many historically significant neighborhoods are experiencing rapid transformation. This map provides a data-driven look at how displacement and gentrification have reshaped the city’s landscape, focusing on the communities most impacted by these shifts.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Timeline**: An animated time slider that shows demographic shifts and development pressure year-by-year.
* **Displacement Velocity Index (DVI)**: A custom metric (0–100) that calculates the speed of neighborhood change based on home values, income, and population turnover.
* **Legacy Business Tracking**: A catalog of local landmarks—both still operating and those lost—to show the human impact of cultural displacement.
* **Regional Comparison**: A side-by-side tool to analyze how different parts of the city (such as the **East 11th Street Corridor** vs. **South Lamar**) are evolving in relation to one another.


## Tracked Neighborhoods

The map currently monitors 15 specific regions, including:

* **East 11th/12th Street Corridor** (African American Cultural Heritage District)
* **East Cesar Chavez / East 5th-7th** (Mexican-American Heritage Corridor)
* **Holly / Rainey Street**
* **Red River Cultural District**
* **Montopolis & Dove Springs**
* **South Congress (SoCo)**

## Data Sources & Methodology

The data in this project is synthesized from several official and community-sourced archives:

* **U.S. Census Bureau**: Decennial data (1990–2020) and American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates.
* **Travis Central Appraisal District (TCAD)**: Historical property values and tax data.
* **City of Austin**: Official boundaries, heritage district plans, and infrastructure projects like Project Connect.
* **Community Inventories**: Local records of business closures and cultural landmarks.

## Built With

* **React**: For the interactive user interface.
* **Leaflet**: For geospatial mapping and overlays.
* **Recharts**: For dynamic demographic and economic charts.
* **D3.js**: For data math and color interpolation.
