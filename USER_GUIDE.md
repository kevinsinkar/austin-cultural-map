# Austin Shifting Ground - User Guide

This guide provides a detailed explanation of the metrics and interactive features found in the Austin Cultural Displacement Map. It is designed to help users interpret the four decades of data regarding neighborhood transformation and resident displacement in Austin.

## Understanding the Displacement Velocity Index (DVI)

The **Displacement Velocity Index (DVI)** is the core metric used in this project to quantify the speed and intensity of change within a specific neighborhood. It is calculated on a scale of **0 to 100**.

### DVI Categories

* **0–20: Stable**
Neighborhoods in this range show minimal demographic turnover and steady property value trends relative to the city average.
* **20–35: Early Pressure**
These areas are beginning to see accelerated home value appreciation and a shift in household income levels.
* **35–55: Active Displacement**
This indicates a high-intensity transition period characterized by significant loss of long-term residents and rapid demographic shifts.
* **55+: Historic Displacement**
This score reflects areas that have undergone a complete structural transformation, often resulting in the permanent loss of the original community character.

## Interactive Features and Overlays

The map allows you to layer different data points to see how infrastructure and policy decisions correlate with neighborhood change.

* **Time Slider**: Adjust the slider to view the state of Austin from 1990 through 2025. This allows for a visual "time-lapse" of how displacement moved from the central core into the Eastern Crescent.
* **Project Connect Overlay**: Toggle this to see planned transit lines. These lines often correlate with "Early Pressure" DVI scores in nearby neighborhoods.
* **Legacy Businesses**: This layer highlights cultural anchors.
* **Operating**: Businesses that have successfully navigated rising rents and demographic shifts.
* **Closed**: Businesses that were forced to shutter or relocate due to redevelopment or financial pressure.


* **Development Pressure**: Highlighting areas with the highest year-over-year increases in appraised property values.

## Data-Driven Advocacy

This map is intended to move beyond simple observation and serve as a tool for local engagement. For residents in Austin districts, the data presented can be used as a factual basis for discussions with local and state representatives regarding housing policy and neighborhood preservation.

### Using This Data for Local Engagement

* **Identify Trends**: Use the timeline to identify which neighborhoods are currently in the "Active Displacement" phase to prioritize community support.
* **Inform Representatives**: Provide specific DVI shifts and legacy business loss data when communicating with state and local officials about district-specific needs.
* **Support Local Activism**: This data can provide a baseline for groups involved in local Austin activism and community resistance efforts.

## Methodology Note

Data is synthesized from the **U.S. Census Bureau**, the **Travis Central Appraisal District**, and community-led business inventories. While demographic data is updated at decennial intervals, socioeconomic metrics are interpolated using American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates to provide a continuous timeline.
