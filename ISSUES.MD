## Project Roadmap: 

Our goal is to move the **Austin Cultural Map** from a retrospective tool to a predictive, action-oriented platform for Preservation Austin’s 2026 strategy.

### 1. Data Integrity & Geographic Expansion

* **15-Neighborhood Audit:** Conduct a full verification of the current 15 neighborhoods against February 2026 TCAD (Travis Central Appraisal District) releases to ensure 100% data confidence.
* **Scale to 25 Neighborhoods:** Incorporate 10 additional high-priority areas, specifically targeting the "North Lamar" and "St. Johns" corridors.
* **Coordinate Precision:** Update neighborhood polygons to align more accurately with community-recognized boundaries rather than just rigid Census tract lines.

### 2. Framework Integration

* **UDP Alignment:** Incorporate methodology from the **Urban Displacement Project (UC Berkeley)** to allow for national benchmarking of Austin’s displacement velocity.
* **Infrastructure Overlay:** Layer the **I-35 Capital Express** and **Project Connect** transit corridors over the Displacement Velocity Index (DVI) to visualize "Transit-Adjacent Displacement."

### 3. Cultural Preservation Features

* **Legacy Business Survival Tracker:** Cross-reference business closure data with high-velocity DVI zones to identify "At-Risk Cultural Anchors."
* **Predictive "At-Risk" Modeling:** Develop a trend-line feature that identifies neighborhoods showing early-stage indicators (e.g., sudden shifts in educational attainment) before home values peak.
* **Community Landmark Layer:** Enable a "soft data" layer for community-sourced assets—murals, social clubs, and gathering spaces—that aren't captured in the U.S. Census.
